But if you’d consider games like this to be 3D games, then 3D platformers got their start back in the 80s! But despite being the first game to feature many of the genre’s now-staple mechanics, *Super Mario 64* wasn’t the first 3D platformer. So while *Alpha Waves* didn’t have the dramatic, long-term impact on the 3D platformer genre that some later games did, it *was* the very first! One of *Alpha Waves*’s most obvious differences compared to modern 3D platformers is in the controls.

But while Sega and Sony had their own attempts during the same time period at 3D rivals, those being Nights and Crash Bandicoot, both of which were excellent games for their time, Mario 64 was, again, the only one that was TRULY 3D, and it was just doing things that were so far advanced that nothing else could really keep up for many years.\", \"score\": 0.84215075, \"raw_content\": null}, {\"url\": \"https://retrovolve.com/the-3d-platformer-how-1996-witnessed-the-birth-of-a-genre/\", \"title\": \"The 3D Platformer: How 1996 Witnessed the Birth of a Genre\", \"content\": \"That’s not technically true, of course, as the first 3D platformer was almost certainly a French game called *Alpha Waves* that came out in 1990.

(*Bubsy 3D*‘s Michael Berlyn did get to see *Super Mario 64* before *Bubsy 3D* launched, but *Bubsy 3D* was too far along in development for Berlyn to take any inspiration from Miyamoto’s masterpiece.) All three of these games had the gargantuan task of figuring out what a platformer should even look like in three dimensions, and each took a vastly different approach. And *Bubsy 3D* focused more on the platforms themselves, and it plays like a lot of time went into solving the problem of what the camera is supposed to do (a problem that, interestingly enough, *Super Mario 64* came much closer to solving by treating the camera as a playable character in the game).\", \"score\": 0.8106142, \"raw_content\": null}, {\"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDOBH0e-8F4\", \"title\": \"Super Mario 64 - It Wasn\\'t First 3D Platformer, But It Is ... - YouTube\", \"content\": \"Super Mario 64 - It Wasn\\'t First 3D Platformer, But It Is The First 3D.. | Retrospective · Comments.\", \"score\": 0.7596005, \"raw_content\": null}]'"
